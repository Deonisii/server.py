## Need improvements:

### Add Events to Game Replays

* Observed Game doesn't generate random events
* **Action.Event**. Inserts in in table ReplayDB:action
* Game process Action Event. This Action generates by Observer

### Cold-Down for random events

Time of cold-down depends of "power attack"


### Process situation of collision more than 2 trains
